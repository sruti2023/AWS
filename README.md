**# Static Website Hosting on AWS using EC2 instance, S3 bucket, Application Gateway, ACM, Route 53 and CloudWatch**
# üåê Deploy a Static Website on AWS

---

## üìã Overview

This guide outlines the steps to deploy a static website on AWS using various services like EC2, S3, IAM, Route 53, and more.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Services Used

- **EC2 Instance**: The compute resource that runs your application or website.
- **Amazon S3 Bucket**: Used to store static assets such as images, videos, backups, and other files needed for the website.
- **IAM**: Grants necessary permissions for EC2 instances to access S3 buckets and other AWS services.
- **Route 53**: Manages DNS records, enabling you to route traffic to your load balancer.
- **Load Balancer**: Distributes incoming traffic across multiple EC2 instances to ensure high availability and reliability.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Additional Components

- **Target Group**: Directs traffic to specific EC2 instances based on health checks and routing rules.
- **Auto Scaling Group**: Ensures the right number of EC2 instances running to handle application load.
- **CloudWatch**: Provides metrics, alarms, and logs to monitor the health and performance of your instances.
- **Launch Template**: Specifies the configuration for EC2 instances (AMI, instance type, key pair, security groups, and IAM roles).
- **AMI**: Used to create new EC2 instances with predefined configurations and installed software.
- **Certificate Manager (ACM)**: Manages SSL/TLS certificates for securing your website or application traffic.

## üìö Procedure

### 1. Create an S3 Bucket
- Create an Amazon S3 bucket to store the static website's contents. This bucket will serve as the primary storage for all website files.

---

### 2. Enable Public Access
- Enable public access to the bucket to make the website accessible to the public.

---

### 3. Upload Website Files
- Upload the static website files into the newly created S3 bucket, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and other assets.

---

### 4. Configure Static Website Hosting
- In the S3 bucket's properties, configure static website hosting by specifying the name of the landing page (e.g., `index.html`).

---

### 5. Edit Bucket Policy
- Edit the bucket policy to make the bucket publicly accessible, ensuring users can access the website files stored in the S3 bucket.

---

### 6. Create an IAM Role
- Create an IAM role with an S3 bucket policy to grant necessary permissions for accessing the S3 bucket.

---

### 7. Launch EC2 Instance
- Launch an EC2 instance of Amazon Linux 2 and attach the previously created IAM role for accessing S3 resources.

---

### 8. Connect to EC2 Instance
- Use x-shell to connect to the EC2 instance through the .pem file and switch from `ec2-user` to the root user. Install the package manager `httpd`.

---

### 9. Install AWS CLI
```bash
sudo yum install aws-cli -y
